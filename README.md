# Sentimental Analysis Using Neural Network

NeuralSentiAnalyzer is a Python library for conducting sentiment analysis using neural network techniques. This library leverages deep learning architectures to accurately analyze and classify sentiments expressed in text data.

## Features

- **Neural Network Models**: NeuralSentiAnalyzer utilizes deep learning models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, for effective sentiment analysis.
- **Preprocessing Utilities**: Preprocessing tools are included to handle tasks such as text encoding, padding sequences, and one-hot encoding.
- **Flexible Framework**: The library offers flexibility for fine-tuning pre-trained models on custom datasets or building custom neural network architectures.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamless integration with popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Community Support**: Join a growing community of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts passionate about sentiment analysis and neural networks.

## Installation

To install NeuralSentiAnalyzer, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alihassanml/NeuralSentiAnalyzer.git
